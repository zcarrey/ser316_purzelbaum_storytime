There once was a little hund who lived in Berlin.
His favorite meal was a piece of brot.
This hund is very wettbewerbsfaehig.
He enjoyed catching the scent of Gebaeck wafting from the nearby Baeckerei.
The Apfelkuchen was definitely one of the most famous things to get in the Baeckerei and it was the hund's favorite.
The hund raced to Flughafen to find a Porsche to travel to the Biergarten fun.
At the Biergarten, the hund, dressed in a stylish Dirndl and Lederhose, eagerly awaited a plate of Bratwurst.
The hund, with a playful twirl in Dirndl and Lederhose, savored Bratwurst bliss.
