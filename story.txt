There once was a little hund who lived in Berlin.
His favorite meal was a piece of brot.
This hund is very wettbewerbsfaehig.
He enjoyed catching the scent of Gebaeck wafting from the nearby Baeckerei.
The Apfelkuchen was definitely one of the most famous things to get in the Baeckerei and it was the hund's favorite.
